### Designed to help alleviate weird connectivity issues between Ubuntu and Taskflow stimulation device

Still a work in progress.

1. Clone the repo to the tdcs home folder (/home/tdcs), using `git clone https://github.com/kenttuominen/Bluetooth_fixer`
2. Enter the folder labeled Bluetooth_fixer using the command `cd ~/Bluetooth_fixer` or `cd /home/tdcs/Bluetooth_fixer`
3. Run the **setup.sh** script by typing `bash setup.sh`

*Make sure you do not run the command as root user; if you do not know what this is don't worry*

4. Enter the password for the computer if prompted and wait ~30 seconds
5. You should see the bluetooth reset icon appear in the favorites bar on the left.
